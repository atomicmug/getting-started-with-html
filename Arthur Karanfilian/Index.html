        <br> The web was "invented" in the early 1990's and currently has approximately 30 billion pages. These pages mainly consist of HTML files (HyperText Markup Language). Hyperlinks are used to link between different pages.
        <br> The major pieces of the web consist of you and your PC, a web browser, Internet connection, and servers. The servers host the html files that you access by using a web browser connected to the PC. These files are accessed via your Internet connection.

        <br> HTML is made up of Text Content (What you can see), Markup (What it looks like), references to other documents (such as images and videos), and links to other pages.
        <br> HTML Markup consists of: &ltname&gt contents &lt/name&gt which contains an opening tag, and a closing tab. This is referred to as an element.</p>

      <p>An HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element. They are usually added to a HTML start tag, which along with content and end tag comprises most HTML elements. Particular attributes are only supported by particular element types; if they are
        added to elements that do not support them they will not function.
        <br> &lttag attr="value"&gt Contents &lt/tag&gt.
